### Post your work on GitHub


### Description
In this project, you will create a GitHub repository and your local repository. You will work on a repo for your BikeShare project, making multiple branches, making edits to files on those branches (e.g., a readme file and your Python code), and then you will commit the changes to your remote repository.

### Credits
It's important to give proper credit. Add links to any repo that inspired you or blogposts you consulted.
